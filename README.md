This is the *File Manager* project I made myself.

Master essential file management techniques with this comprehensive Python project. From navigating directories and viewing file sizes to advanced operations.

You'll get into the depths of os module, allowing you to perform numerous operations with files and folders on your computer. Learn to check file parameters and keep track of operations to reverse them when needed. As a little bonus, get familiar with basic Unix commands.

We bet you know how to rename, copy, and delete files on your computer, but have you ever considered creating your file manager? This project will help you do just that. You can guide your file helper through folders, check sizes, and edit content. It's a must-have tool for organizing your computer.

This project does the following tasks:

* Deal with absolute and relative directory paths and implement several commands to move between folders.
* Let's see what's taking up space on the hard drive. List the files contained in a folder and check their sizes.
* Upgrade the file manager to remove and rename files and create directories.
* Use the methods to copy files or move them to other directories.
* Let's speed up the process and introduce name templates to the manager.
